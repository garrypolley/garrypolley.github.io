title: Java: Mac OSX JAVA_HOME
layout: post
---

I’m still getting everything setup for development on my new retina display mac book pro, which is awesome, and I encountered an issue. I’ve not really done java dev on a mac, mostly linux or windows. Apparently the JAVA_HOME that you get for free on linux is not used on the mac. You’ll need to add JAVA_HOME to your .bash_profile, or equivalent depending on your terminal choice.

Upon google searching I was lead to this email archive that gave me the solution: http://lists.apple.com/archives/java-dev/2011/Jul/msg00172.html.

I need to add this to my .bash_profile for it to work:

```sh
export JAVA_HOME=`/usr/libexec/java_home`
```
