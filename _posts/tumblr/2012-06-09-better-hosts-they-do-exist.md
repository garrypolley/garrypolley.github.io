I started the day today working on some stuff for @linkminded.  Through working on this I decided I needed some github integration, so I decided I'd look at a project created by Rigo.  The project mentioned in my earlier blog posts.
By working on this little side project to get my website up I have found out a few things:

1. Don't use hostmonster, they are slow, and I couldn't setup a naked dns entry to save my life.
2. AWS is cool, but when you want free that is good, use Heroku
3. When everyone recommends a specific way to do something, don't try to reinvent the wheel.  
4. DNSimple makes it really easy to setup your DNS stuff so you can use heroku
