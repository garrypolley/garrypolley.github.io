I'm a developer that loves to make developing easier. Currently I focus
on web development. I work client side with JavaScript, though I dislike
it due to browsers.  I prefer to skip the middle and go straight to the
back part of the website. Be-it a database or a deployments that is the
niche of the server I like to fill. I can do Rails and Django development.
Though if I'm going to be doing them I prefer something more fun than
making a simple CRUD view. Fortunately there are easy ways to make that
happen.

You'll likely see lots of stuff on this website, mostly around some
kind of blog posts.  I generally focus on technical stuff but every once
in awhile I like to post about other stuff.  I'll also post a fair amount
of "small" blogs; those are mostly notes for myself to remember how
to do something.

Thanks for stopping by and feel free to reach out if you need with
anything!
