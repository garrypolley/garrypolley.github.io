<p>Just got my site up for real thanks to some help from Ryan Niemeyer @rniemeyer and Rodrigo Neri @rigoneri.
I used 2 projects to help get it up and going one from Ryan to help me figure out how to deploy out in AWS land: https://github.com/ryanniemeyer/uriz
The other project from rigo which is the actual site with small modifications to actually be about me:  https://github.com/rigoneri/syte</p>

<p>I’ve been wanting to play around with AWS on my own and also get my website to no longer be ‘under construction”.  </p>
