<p>I’m still getting everything setup for development on my new retina display mac book pro, which is awesome, and I encountered an issue.  I’ve not really done java dev on a mac, mostly linux or windows.   Apparently the JAVA_HOME that you get for free on linux is not used on the mac.  You’ll need to add JAVA_HOME to your .bash_profile, or equivalent depending on your terminal choice.</p>

<p>Upon google searching I was lead to this email archive that gave me the solution: http://lists.apple.com/archives/java-dev/2011/Jul/msg00172.html.</p>

<p>I need to add this to my .bash_profile for it to work:</p>

<p>export JAVA_HOME=<code>/usr/libexec/java_home</code></p>
