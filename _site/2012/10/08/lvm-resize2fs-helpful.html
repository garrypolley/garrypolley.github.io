<p>Problem:</p>

<p>I need more space on a disk partition (/opt)</p>

<p>Solution:</p>

<p>Use lvm and resize2fs to give more space to /opt</p>

<p>How to do:</p>

<p>LVM is a logical volume manager.  I was able to use to add free disk space to an existing linux box’s /opt folder so I could get mongo up and running in a sane configuration.</p>

<p>Here’s what I did:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>df -ah
…
/dev/mapper/vg00-opt
                       4.1G  1.1G   3 25% /opt
…</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That told me I only had 4.1 G usable on the /opt partition.  For mongo this is a no go.  Next I needed to see how much free space I had left on the box:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>vgdisplay
  — Volume group —
…
  Free  PE / Size       20000/ 20000
..</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Seeing that I had a ton of free space I then added 15G to my /opt partition</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>lvresize -L +100%FREE /dev/mapper/vg00-opt</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now that it was added, I needed the file system to see it as well.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>resize2fs /dev/mapper/vg00-opt</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Boom, now I have increased my partition size.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>df -ah
…
/dev/mapper/vg00-opt
                       26G  4.5G   20G  19% /opt
…</p>
</blockquote>
