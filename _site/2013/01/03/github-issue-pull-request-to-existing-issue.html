<p>I was always wondering how to issue a pull request on an issue that already existed on Github…  Now I know how. Thanks to this link: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4528869/how-do-you-attach-a-new-pull-request-to-an-existing-issue-on-github
Basically all I needed to do was:
install hub
brew install hub
issue request to existing issue (must be inside git repo)
hub pull-request URL_TO_ISSUE
Now your request is made</p>
