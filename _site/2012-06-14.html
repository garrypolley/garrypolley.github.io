<p>I used to do some work for http://www.videomarketingusa.com/ and I learned a fair amount about SEO.  The easiest thing I learned that helps a site is making sure your www.mysite.come poitns to mysite.com, or vice-versa.  I was having some difficulty doing this with using hostmonster because I prefer the http://mysite.com over http://www.mysite.comwww.mysite.come poitns to mysite.com, or vice-versa.  I was having some difficulty doing this with using hostmonster because I prefer the http://mysite.com over http://www.mysite.com, less typing.</p>

<p>Because of this I switched to <a href="https://dnsimple.com/">DNSimple</a>.  I googled around for how to get heroku to re-direct http://www to http://.  I saw some complex stuff about doing middleware and updating some specific config on your boxâ€¦ that seemed like over kill, so I just took a peek at the many options DNSimple gives you for domain setups, WIN.  I found one called URL, guess what?  It does exactly what I wanted:  http://www.garrypolley.com now points to http://garrypolley.com.</p>

<p>tl;dr</p>

<p>Use the URL option on DNSimple to make a 301 redirect from http://www.mysite.com to http://mysite.com</p>
